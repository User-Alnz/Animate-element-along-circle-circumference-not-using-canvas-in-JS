### A few words 

This project has been made to avoid using HTML canvas HTML5 to move an element onto circle circumference.
Use the code to animate an element in your page to draw a circle with it. 

The method is explained in the following link: https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/9607/moving-an-object-in-a-circular-path

To explain it simply we use a right triangle into a circle. we determine the radius as the hypothenuse.
Then if you know your angleÂ° you can easily determine which coordinates the hypotenuse is pointing along the circumference as much as the angle value is increased (using Cos & Sin).
